# First 😎

## About Me
I'm Arav Prajapat, a first-year B.Tech student interested in Computer Science—especially Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I also love exploring data and have a growing interest in Data Science.

## About This Repository
This is my **first repository**, created to:
- Track my learning journey (starting with C++ and DSA)
- Share beginner-friendly code with others starting out
- Show consistent effort and growth over time

_Started on: 7th August 2025_

## What to Expect
Right now, you'll find:
- C++ programs from my DSA learning
- Simple, beginner-focused code

In the future, I'll:
- Create separate repos for projects and ideas in AI/ML
- Post more structured content and documentation

**This is just the beginning. More to come. 🚀**

Thanks for stopping by ❤️
