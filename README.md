# First😎

I'm Arav Prajapat, a First year Btech student interested in computer science and eager to learn Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mere future. 

Also, I love playing with data and interested in some fields of Data Science.
This is just my first repostory so it has nothing to do with my professional career.
I just made this to track my progress and also to show anyone concerned that im working and yeah my journey is being recorded in this repo.

The Basic reason for this is to let any beginner use my code to learn in their journey and today dated 7th Aug 2025, I'm Just a beginner and learning c++ for my Data Structures and Algorithms.

This is just the beginning, More specific content I will post on further repostories in future.🚀

In this First repostory, I am just tracking my DSA journey and in future will create more repostories for field related projects and ideas.


THANK YOU ❤️
